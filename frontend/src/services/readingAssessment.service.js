Please note that passengers can only take ONE suitcase onto the plane. It must be no bigger
than 55cm x 22cm x 35cm and weigh no more than 10kg.
You can also take one small laptop bag or handbag that can fit under the seat in front of you.
If you have two bags, their total weight cannot be more than 10kg. If your bag is too big or
too heavy, you will not be allowed to take it onto the plane. Staff will put it in the hold for you
and you will have to pay extra.
Please make sure mobile phones and other devices are fully charged so that security staff can
check them.
Liquids in bottles bigger than 100ml are allowed on board if you buy them in the airport shops
after you've passed security.

You don't want just a gym membership. You want a membership that means something. And
that means you need support, expert help and a community.
Best Body Fitness isn't just a gym: it's a full-service fitness membership made for you.

why you are doing it. After a few sessions with an expert private trainer you will feel
comfortable working out on your own. But don't worry, we'll always be nearby if you have
questions.
STEP THREE: Your membership
Membership works on a month-to-month basis. There are no sign-up fees and no cancellation
fees. Start and stop whenever you want. And the best part? Our fees are the most competitive
in the whole downtown area.
STEP FOUR: Your community
At Best Body Fitness, we see everyone as part of a big team. And when you work with a
team, you can do great things. Join any of our specialised classes, led by expert instructors.
Come to our nutrition classes. Participate in our regular social events. Everything is included
in your fee.
Finally, we wanted to share with you some reasons why our members say that they have
chosen us over any other fitness centre in the city.

        text: `Sam squinted against the sun at the distant dust trail raked up by the car on its way up to the
Big House. The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, not caring about their owner's first
visit in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter didn't come out here unless he had to, which was
just fine by Sam. The more he kept out of his boss's way, the longer he'd have a job.
Carter came by later while Sam was chopping wood. Carter lifted his hat as if he were waiting
for an appointment with the town priest, and then removed it completely as if he were talking
to his mother. He pulled out a pile of paper from his back pocket and held it out.
'Don't pick up your mail often, do you?'
Sam took it without a glance and dropped the envelopes onto the bench.
'Never,' he replied and waited for Carter to say why he was here. The fact it was Carter's
house was no explanation and they both knew it. Carter twisted his hat round and round,
licking his lips and clearing his throat.
'Nice work fixing those fences,' he said finally.
'I'll be back to the beginning soon,' Sam said. It wasn't a complaint. A fence that took a year to
repair meant another year's work to the man who did it well.
'Don't you ever want to take a holiday?'
'And go where?' A holiday meant being back out in the real world, a place even people like
Carter travelled to escape from. Sam's escape was his reality and he wasn't going back.
Mr Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck. The damp patches on his shirt drew
together like shapes in an atlas. His skin was already turning ruddy in the June sun. Otherwise
he had the indoor tan of a man that made money while other people did the work.
'I've brought my son with me on this trip. He's had some trouble at school.' Mr Carter's eyes
flicked up, blinked rapidly and then shifted back to the hat occupying his hands. 'Not much
trouble out here for a young boy.' He attempted a laugh but it came out like a dog's bark.
The two men looked towards the northern end of the property. It stretched as far as the eye
could see. Even the fences were barely visible from where they stood. However bored and
rebellious a teenage boy might get, it wasn't possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the
biggest of the horses, kicking at the ground with its heavy hooves. Could the boy ride? he
wondered. There was a whole load of trouble a good rider could get into out here, miles away
from anyone. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about
horses and wanted to get away from his father.`,

        title: 'A biography of Kilian Jornet',
        text: `When you picture mountain climbers scaling Mount Everest, what probably comes to mind are
teams of climbers with Sherpa guides leading them to the summit, equipped with oxygen
masks, supplies and tents. And in most cases you'd be right, as 97 per cent of climbers use
oxygen to ascend to Everest's summit at 8,850 metres above sea level. The thin air at high
altitudes makes most people breathless at 3,500 metres, and the vast majority of climbers use
oxygen past 7,000 metres. A typical climbing group will have 8â€“15 people in it, with an almost
equal number of guides, and they'll spend weeks to get to the top after reaching Base Camp.
But ultra-distance and mountain runner Kilian Jornet Burgada ascended the mountain in May
2017 alone, without an oxygen mask or fixed ropes for climbing.
Oh, and he did it in 26 hours.
With food poisoning.
And then, five days later, he did it again, this time in only 17 hours.
Born in 1987, Kilian has been training for Everest his whole life. And that really does mean his
whole life, as he grew up 2,000 metres above sea level in the Pyrenees in the ski resort of
Lles de Cerdanya in Catalonia, north-eastern Spain. While other children his age were learning
to walk, Kilian was on skis. At one and a half years old he did a five-hour hike with his mother,
entirely under his own steam. He left his peers even further behind when he climbed his first
mountain and competed in his first cross-country ski race at age three. By age seven, he had
scaled a 4,000er and, at ten, he did a 42-day crossing of the Pyrenees.
He was 13 when he says he started to take it 'seriously' and trained with the Ski
Mountaineering Technical Centre (CTEMC) in Catalonia, entering competitions and working
with a coach. At 18, he took over his own ski-mountaineering and trail-running training, with a
schedule that only allows a couple of weeks of rest a year. He does as many as 1,140 hours of
endurance training a year, plus strength training and technical workouts as well as specific
training in the week before a race. For his record-breaking ascent and descent of the
Matterhorn, he prepared by climbing the mountain ten times until he knew every detail of it,
even including where the sun would be shining at every part of the day.
Sleeping only seven hours a night, Kilian Jornet seems almost superhuman. His resting
heartbeat is extremely low at 33 beats per minute, compared with the average man's 60 per
minute or an athlete's 40 per minute. He breathes more efficiently than average people too,
taking in more oxygen per breath, and he has a much faster recovery time after exercise as
his body quickly breaks down lactic acid â€“ the acid in muscles that causes pain after exercise.
All this is thanks to his childhood in the mountains and to genetics, but it is his mental strength
that sets him apart. He often sets himself challenges to see how long he can endure difficult
conditions in order to truly understand what his body and mind can cope with. For example,
he almost gave himself kidney failure after only drinking 3.5 litres of water on a 100km run in
temperatures of around 40Â°C.
It would take a book to list all the races and awards he's won and the mountains he's climbed.
And even here, Kilian's achievements exceed the average person as, somehow, he finds time
to record his career on his blog and has written three books, Run or Die, The Invisible
Border and Summits of My Life.`,
