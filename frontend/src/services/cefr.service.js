        transcript: `Hi, everyone. I know you're all busy so I'll keep this briefing quick. I have some important
information about a change in the management team. As you already know, our head of
department, James Watson, is leaving his position at the end of this week. His replacement is
starting at the end of the next month. In the meantime, we'll continue with our projects as
usual.
I have two more quick points. Firstly, there will be some improvements made to the staff car
park next month for a few weeks. It will be closed during that time.
Don't worry, we've found a solution. We can use the local church car park until our own one is
ready. If you arrive before 8.30 a.m., please use our small car park on Brown Street, and if you
arrive after that, you should go directly to the church car park. It's only a five-minute walk
away. But they need it in the evenings, so you have to leave before 6 p.m. Sorry about that – I
know how much you all love working late!
The other thing I wanted to tell you about is that the canteen has now introduced a cashless
payment system. So, you can't use cash for payments any more. You can pay directly with
your smartphone or you can pay using your company ID card. The total amount put on your
company ID card comes off your salary at the end of each month.
OK. That's it? Are there any questions?`

        transcript: `Teacher: So you've got a few minutes to discuss with your partner.
Student 1: So, as far as I know, the main similarity between Mars and Earth is that they can
both support human life.
Student 2: Yeah, but do we know that's actually true? I mean, Mars is much colder than Earth,
isn't it? It says here it's about minus 55 degrees most of the time, whereas on Earth only
places like Antarctica get that cold.
Student 1: True. Well then, I suppose you could say both planets are a similar distance from
the Sun?
Student 2: No way! Mars is much further away! It says here it's about 228 million kilometres,
while Earth is about 150 million.
Student 1: Yes, but in space that's not that far. Jupiter is, like, almost 780 million kilometres.
That's why we use astronomical units when we talk about distances in space. Earth is 1
astronomical unit from the Sun and Mars is 1.3. The difference doesn't sound so big when you
look at it that way.
Student 2: I see what you mean. Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units so I guess you're right. What
other similarities are there between the two planets?
Student 1: Let's see … not the colour, obviously!
Student 2: Yeah! Earth is called the blue planet and Mars is called the red planet for pretty
obvious reasons!
Student 1: Their sizes are pretty different. Mars is about half the size of Earth.
Student 2: What about this? It looks like the days on both planets are almost the same length.
Earth's day is 24 hours but Mars's is about half an hour longer.
Student 1: You're right. OK, any other things they both share?
Student 2: I suppose you could say they have water in common.
Student 1: Could you? How?
Student 2: Well, Earth is 70 per cent water and Mars probably had huge oceans in the past.
It's just that most of the water there now is probably frozen.
Student 1: Ah, I see. I don't think we can say the air is the same, though. Most of Earth's air is
nitrogen and oxygen, but Mars …?
Student 2: Mars doesn't really have air, not compared with Earth. It's got about one per
cent as much air as Earth.
Student 1: Right, and it's mostly carbon dioxide.
Student 2: Gravity is another difference. I didn't know this, but Mars has higher gravity than
the Moon. But it's much less than on Earth, of course.
Student 1: Oh, yes. It says Mars has about 38 per cent of Earth's gravity.
Teacher: OK, let's see what you've found …`

        transcript: `Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to this short presentation on our new product design. As you
know, we've already redeveloped our 'Adventure' shampoo to make it more modern and
appealing. And we've renamed it 'Adventure Tech'. Our market research established the target
market as men in the 18–40 age range who like to be outdoors and also like technical
gadgets, such as smartwatches, drones and things like that. We needed to create a bottle
which appeals to that market.
So, today, I'm happy to unveil our new bottle design. As you can see, it's designed to look like
a black metal drinking flask, with some digital features printed on it.
I'd like to talk you through the following three points: the key features, sizing and our timeline
for production.
Firstly, you'll notice it has an ergonomic design. That means it fits smoothly into your hand and
can be easily opened and squeezed using one hand. And, it looks like a flask you might use
when hiking outdoors. The imitation digital displays are designed to remind the user of other
tech devices they may have, such as a smartwatch or smart displays in their home.
I'd now like to tell you about the sizes. It comes in two sizes: the regular size and a small travel
size. The travel size is the same type of design – a flask, also with imitation digital displays on
the bottle. We were thinking of starting with one and following with the travel-size in a few
months, but we've worked hard and both are ready now.
Finally, I'm going to talk to you about our timeline for production. You've probably heard that
we're launching in two months. In preparation for that, we're starting the marketing campaign
next month. You can see the complete overview of all phases in this Gantt chart.
In summary, the bottle's been designed for men who like adventure and technology, and it
comes in two sizes. The marketing campaign is starting next month and we're launching the
product in two months.
OK. So, any questions? Feel free to also email me for further information in case we run out of
time.`

        transcript: `Interviewer: Hello, Maria. Thanks for coming in for the interview.
Maria: It's my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.
Interviewer: Well, as you know, the company has been expanding and we have an opening in
our HR department. We're creating a new role for someone to lead our training and
development within the company.
Maria: Yes, I very much think that my skills and experience are a good fit for what you're
looking for.
Interviewer: That sounds great. So, your CV looks strong, though it would be good if you
could give us an overview, in your own words, of what you've been doing over the past four
years or so.
Maria: Well, in my first job, four years ago, I was working for a small HR services provider
which offered HR services, including L&D, to corporate clients.
Interviewer: OK, so it was only B2B?
Maria: Yes, we only offered services to other companies, not B2C.
Interviewer: Right, and it says here you then left that company about three years ago.
Maria: Yes, that's right. I was looking for a little more stability and also to be part of a larger
organisation. So I joined a company with around one hundred staff and a small HR team. As
there are only a few of us, we each deal with a range of HR topics. In addition to payroll, one
of the areas I was responsible for was learning and development.
Interviewer: I see. And, so why do you want to change jobs now?
Maria: Well, I very much like the L&D side of my role and I've always had particularly good
feedback for my work in this area. I believe I excel in that field. So, I'm looking to specialise,
and as your company has around 2,000 people, right …?
Interviewer: Yes, that's right.
Maria: Well, an organisation of this size would give me the scope to specialise in L&D. I'm also
a big follower of your brand and feel fully aligned with your image and values.
Interviewer: Well, that all sounds good. And I can see you have an L&D qualification.
Maria: Yes, I got a diploma two years ago. I am also currently working on a further diploma in
psychology, with a specific focus on learning and performance management.
Interviewer: Very good. Well, it looks like you have the qualifications and experience we're
looking for. What do you think will be the main challenges of coming to a much larger
company?
Maria: I can see that it might be perceived as a weakness to not have experience in an
organisation of this size, though I see that it could also be a benefit. I won't be bringing too
many preconceived and possibly inflexible ideas with me to the role.
Interviewer: Yes, that would be a good thing.
Maria: Also, I'm used to taking a very personal approach to employee development. I realise
that such an approach with 2,000 staff members will have to happen in a different way, but I
bring many ideas with me that can be replicated on a larger scale.
Interviewer: I see what you mean. Right, so, do you have any questions for me?
Maria: Um, I think we've covered many of the areas I had wanted to address. I have two quick
questions though.
Interviewer: Go on.
Maria: Who would I mostly work with on a daily basis?
Interviewer: Well, there's the HR manager who you would report to. And then the HR team,
which currently has six people in it. There's usually an intern or two who you can get some
support from also.
Maria: OK. Thanks. That's all really clear. And my other question is how performance in this
role will be measured. What does success look like?
Interviewer: That's a good question. As you know, we have a performance management
system in place, and from that we have identified some learning and development needs
within the organisation. But we haven't devised a strategy. Your role would be to devise and
then successfully implement this strategy.
Maria: Thank you. That sounds interesting.
Interviewer: Great. So, thanks again for coming in today. We'll be discussing all candidates
next week and then I'll get back to you by the end of next week to let you know the outcome.
Maria: Thank you for your time. I'd welcome the opportunity to continue discussing this role
with you.`
